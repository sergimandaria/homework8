            <p class="paragrap">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some
                people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly
                fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course,
                I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can
                help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
                only say
                wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                hands-on and I
                never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                my learning to
                the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                interviews as an
                example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
